# Automated Fish Feeder

This is a prototype for an automated fish feeder I started working on.  I was able to design a hopper with a screw drive mechanism driven by arduino using a COTS stepper moter driver.

I bailed on the project because I actualy need more precise dispensing of food for the fish I was planning to get and haven't had time to update the design.

My plan for the future is to have slots sized appropriately for the fish food at a given interval and use an emitter/sensor pair to verify that a pellet was actually dispensed.

I figured I'd put this up in case somebody else wanted a kickoff point to start the same project. :)
